<p><strong>John</strong> asked about a problem when accessing CUPS on Linux Mint which a friend had encountered; Firefox had warned him that the connection was not secure — something John had never encountered. David said it was Firefox expecting an <code>https</code> connection and he should just click on the blue button to allow him to proceed.</p><p><strong>Darren</strong> had had a number of crashes with KDE Plasma; John wondered if he needed to try Wayland but David said it was more likely to be an incompatibility between Qt versions or a hardware problem such as a video card or memory module needing reseating. Following further discussion, it became clear that Darren was running <a href="http://www.slackware.com/" type="text/html" role="link">Slackware</a> Current and David recommended a complete update of Current and, if the problem persisted, then to investigate possible hardware problems.</p><p><strong>David</strong> picked up a conversation about Unix time which had taken place on the mailing list. He had established that the creators of Unix had used a PDP11 which didn’t have a realtime clock; you had to pay money to get a clock which gave you an interrupt every 50<sup>th</sup> or 60<sup>th</sup> of a second dependent on the mains frequency.</p><p>The creators of Unix gave Unix time a signed integer for ease of calculation but unsigned integers were in practice not that common at the time. There were unsigned integers in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I" type="text/html" role="link">PL/1</a> but they tended not to be used until the arrival of minicomputers.</p><p>Multics had 72bit microsecond precision but nothing could use it.</p><p>None of these systems relied on a realtime clock; they relied on the operator typing the date and time correctly. VAXs had a PDP11 operating as a console where you would enter the date and time. The VAX firmware was on a floppy which you put into the PDP11. VAX VMS had <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/microfortnight" type="text/html" role="link">microfortnights</a>, approximately 1 second, which were used to define the time it waited for the operator to type in the date and time.</p><p>David mentioned that, in view of the exorbitant cost of storage, he was converting his videos from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Video_Coding" type="text/html" role="link">H.264</a> to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Video_Coding" type="text/html" role="link">H.265</a> to save space but was bemused by the complexity of the FFmpeg command line; the process needed scripting. It also took a long time to convert each video.</p><p><strong>Bernard</strong> mentioned that he had been looking at <a href="https://sliderulemuseum.com/VirtualSR2/index.shtml" type="text/html" role="link">slide rule emulations</a> written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript" type="text/html" role="link">Javascript</a>.</p>
